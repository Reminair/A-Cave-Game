# ACG (A Cave Game)
ACG is an attempt to rewrite old versions of minecraft (I'm talking alpha/pre-alpha, beta at latest) in rust.
The goal is to have a fully open-source, well documented Minecraft clone using only rust as the language, and bevy as the engine.
This is going to be a **heavy** learning experience for me because I am quite new to rust.
In fact the only real experience I have with it are my contributions to Orion's Xenon.

## Why are am I doing this?
Mainly because I thought it sounded like a cool project, but also because it totally is a cool project.
